- Admin can assign settings to different users.

### User
- User will have access to his settings.
- User can provide response to the questions provided by the settings form.

# Frontend:
- Front end is built using React, templated with TypeScript. React-Bootstrap is used as UI layer and API requests are handled using axios.

# Backend
- Backend is bootstrapped through NestJS and MongoDB is used as DB. I preferred NestJS because of  good TypeScript support and modular architecture. Furthermore, it provides built in module for MongoDB as well.
